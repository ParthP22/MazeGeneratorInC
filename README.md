# MazeGeneratorInC

Implementing various Minimum Spanning Algorithms to generate mazes using the C programming language!

1/5/2025 Update: Kruskal's Algorithm has been fully implemented!

Prototype v.1.0.0 - 1/6/2024: the maze can successfully be generated by using Kruskal's algorithm, but many more features need to be added still.
