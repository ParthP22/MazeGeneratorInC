# MazeGeneratorInC

Implementing various Minimum Spanning Algorithms to generate mazes using the C programming language!

1/5/2025 Update: Kruskal's Algorithm has been fully implemented!

8/3/2025 Update: A new Edge struct was added in edge.h. It has helped make the code a lot more readable and eliminated my use of "magic numbers", which will further eliminate technical debt and allow me to add new ideas in the future.
